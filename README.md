# SpeciesDistributionToolkit

üó∫Ô∏è `SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl` is a collection of Julia packages forming a
toolkit meant to deal with (surprise!) species distribution data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All of the packages are installed automatically, so you can simply do
> `import Pkg; Pkd.add("SpeciesDistributionToolkit")` and get started.

Specifically, the goal of these packages put together is to provide a consistent way to handle
occurrence data, put them on a map, and make it interact with environmental
information. 

The up-to-date documentation for the *stable* version can be found [here](https://poisotlab.github.io/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl). It contains tutorials showcasing the package in action, how-to guids to serve as a quick reference, and links to the documentation for all methods in the component packages.
