**Filters a series of records**

This function will take the filter function `f` and use it to *mask* the records
that do not satisfy it. Note that if a record is *already* masked due to the
application of a previous filter, its status will *not* be modified. The
application of filters is therefore cumulative.

Note that while the usual `filter!` function *removes* objects, this one will
only *mask* them. The objects can be unmasked with `allrecords!`. This design
choice was made because `GBIFRecords` track the position in the API pages, and
it seemed safer to keep all information. Note that when calling `length` or
iterating over a `GBIFRecords` object, only the *unmasked* records will be
shown.

It is possible to apply multiple filters at once, using the following syntax:

    filter!.([f1, f2, f3], records)
