# # Working with climate data

# The purpose of this vignette is to show how isothermality will change in Iceland under
# a specific climate change scenario, and to map the results.

# As with other vignettes, we will define a bounding box encompassing out region of
# interest:

spatial_extent = (left = -24.785, right = -12.634, top = 66.878, bottom = 62.935)

# We will get the BioClim data from CHELSA v1. CHELSA v1 offers access to the 19 original
# bioclim variable, and their projection under a variety of CMIP5 models/scenarios.
# These are pretty large data, and so this operation may take a while in terms of download/read
# time. The first time you run this command will download the data, and the next calls will
# read them from disk.

dataprovider = RasterData(CHELSA1, BioClim)

# In the BioClim parlance, isothermality is `"BIO3"`, so this is the layer we will request.
# We wrap this inside a tuple to make the subsequent function calls faster to write.

data_info = (layer = "BIO3",)

# Note that we do not *need* to give the bounding box and layer data as distinct variables,
# but this is more convenient in terms of code re-use. For this reason, we follow this
# convention throughout the documentation.

# The first step is quite simply to grab the reference state for the isothermality, by
# specifying the layer and the spatial extent:

isotherm_current = SimpleSDMPredictor(dataprovider; data_info..., spatial_extent...)

# We can have a little look at this dataset by checking the density of the values for
# isothermality:

density(
    filter(!isnan, vec(last(sprinkle(isotherm_current)))); color = (:grey, 0.5),
    figure = (; resolution = (800, 300)),
    axis = (; xlabel = "Raw isothermality data"),
)

# They look very high, because CHELSA1 stores the temperature-related data multiplied by
# ten; moving forward, we will need to call `0.1layer` to get a layer scaled by the correct
# amount.

# The packages interact with *Makie* (including *GeoMakie*) with the `sprinkle` function
# (the name of which is obviously inspired by the *Makie* package) to make it easy to
# produce good quality maps:

figure = Figure(; resolution = (800, 700))
panel_current = GeoAxis(
    figure[1, 1];
    dest = "+proj=latlon",
    lonlims = extrema(longitudes(isotherm_current)),
    latlims = extrema(latitudes(isotherm_current)),
)
iso_current_hm = heatmap!(
    panel_current,
    sprinkle(convert(Float32, 0.1isotherm_current))...;
    shading = false,
    interpolate = false,
    colormap = :oslo,
)
current_figure()

# In the next step, we will download the projected climate data under RCP26. This requires
# setting up a projection object, which is composed of a scenario and a model. This
# information is used by the package to verify that this combination exists within the
# dataset we are working with.

projection = Projection(RCP26, IPSL_CM5A_MR)

# Future data are available for different years, so we will take a look at what years are
# available:

SimpleSDMDatasets.timespans(dataprovider, projection)

# If we do not specify an argument, the data retrieved will be the ones for the closest
# timespan. Getting the projected isothermality is the *same* call as before, except we now pass an
# additional argument -- the projection.

isotherm_proj =
    SimpleSDMPredictor(dataprovider, projection; data_info..., spatial_extent...)

# With this information, we can update the existing figure, to add a second panel with the
# difference in isothermality:

panel_future = GeoAxis(
    figure[2, 1];
    dest = "+proj=latlon",
    lonlims = extrema(longitudes(isotherm_current)),
    latlims = extrema(latitudes(isotherm_current)),
)
iso_future_hm = heatmap!(
    panel_future,
    sprinkle(convert(Float32, 0.1(isotherm_proj - isotherm_current)))...;
    shading = false,
    interpolate = false,
    colormap = :roma,
)
Colorbar(figure[2, end + 1]; height = Relative(0.7), colorrange = (-2, 2), colormap = :roma)
