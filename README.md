# SpeciesDistributionToolkit

üó∫Ô∏è `SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl` is a collection of Julia packages forming a
toolkit meant to deal with (surprise!) species distribution data. Specifically,
the goal of these packages put together is to provide a consistent way to handle
occurrence data, put them on a map, and make it interact with environmental
information.

ü§ì From a technical point of view, this *repository* is a [Monorepo][mnrp]
consisting of several related packages to work with species distribution data.
These packages were formerly independent and tied together with moxie and
`Require`, which was less than ideal. All the packages forming the toolkit share
a version number (which was set based on the version number of the eldest
package, `SimpleSDMLayers`), and the toolkit itself has its own version number.
