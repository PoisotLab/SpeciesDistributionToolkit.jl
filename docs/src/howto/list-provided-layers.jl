# # ... know which layers are provided?

# This page gives an overview of the methods to get access to additional
# information about the data available through different data providers. Note that
# the documentation website has a series of auto-generated pages that summarize
# the same information.

using SpeciesDistributionToolkit
using InteractiveUtils

# Note that when working from the REPL, `InteractiveUtils` is loaded by default.

# Data are identified by a `RasterProvider` (*e.g.* the initiative or website
# providing the data), and a `RasterDataset` that is a collection of layers
# representing specific information.

# ## Listing the providers

subtypes(RasterProvider)

# ## Listing the datasets associated to a provider

# The `provides` method from `SimpleSDMDatasets` will return `true` if the provide
# offers the dataset:

[ds for ds in subtypes(RasterDataset) if SimpleSDMDatasets.provides(WorldClim2, ds)]

# ## Datasets with multiple layers

# The `layers` and `layerdescriptions` methods return a list of layers:

SimpleSDMDatasets.layers(RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim))

#-

SimpleSDMDatasets.layerdescriptions(RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim))
