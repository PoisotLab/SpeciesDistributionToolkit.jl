# SpeciesDistributionsToolkit

This is a [Monorepo][mnrp] consisting of several related packages to work with species
distribution data. These packages were formerly independent and tied together with the use
of `Require`, which is not the case anymore.

The *core* package is `SpeciesDistributionsToolkit.jl`, and it currently ships with:

🦌 `GBIF.jl`
: a wrapper around the GBIF API, to retrieve taxa and occurrence datasets


🗺️ `SimpleSDMDatasets.jl`
: a series of wrappers around providers of raster datasets for use in species distribution models


💻 `SimpleSDMLayers.jl`
: a series of types and usual operations to handle raster data


📊 `Fauxcurrences.jl`
: a package to simulate faux species with distances distributions that
mimick empirical ones
