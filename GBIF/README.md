# GBIF wrapper for Julia

This is project offers an interface to the [GBIF] search API from
Julia. Current efforts focus on querying and exporting occurrences through the
`occurrence/search` endpoint. There is partial support for the taxonomic API.

The recommended way to use this package is through the
`SpeciesDistributionToolkit` package.
