A good example is the BioClim dataset, provided by a number of sources, that often has different URLs and filenames. This is handled (in e.g. CHELSA2) by writing a method for the general case of any dataset RasterData{CHELSA2,T} (using a Union type), and then a specific method on RasterData{CHELSA2,BioClim}.

For sparse datasets and/or clumped occurrences, this means that JS will return a value that can still be compared by the optimizer. Note also that for a JS distance of x, the equivalent KL divergence would be of the order of x².
