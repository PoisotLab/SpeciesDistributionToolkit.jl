# In this tutorial, we will reproduce (the spirit of) [the excellent tutorial on
# SDMs by Damaris Zurell](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/), using the
# same species and location, a similar dataset, but a slightly different
# algorithm.

# package!

# ## Getting the data

CHE = SpeciesDistributionToolkit.gadm("CHE");

# In order to simplify the code, we will start from a list of bioclim variables
# that have been picked to optimize the model:

bio_vars = [1, 11, 5, 8, 6]

# We get the data on these variables from CHELSA2:

provider = RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim)
layers = [
    SDMLayer(
        provider;
        layer = x,
        left = 0.0,
        right = 20.0,
        bottom = 35.0,
        top = 55.0,
    ) for x in bio_vars
];

# And we then clip and trim to the polygon describing Switzerland:

layers = [trim(mask!(layer, CHE)) for layer in layers];
layers = map(l -> convert(SDMLayer{Float32}, l), layers);

# The next step is to get the data, using the *eBird* dataset:

ouzel = taxon("Turdus torquatus")
presences = occurrences(
    ouzel,
    first(layers),
    "occurrenceStatus" => "PRESENT",
    "limit" => 300,
    "datasetKey" => "4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e",
)
while length(presences) < count(presences)
    occurrences!(presences)
end

# And after this, we prepare a layer with presence data:

presencelayer = mask(first(layers), Occurrences(mask(presences, CHE)))

# The next step is to generate a pseudo-absence mask. We will sample based on
# the distance to an observation, by also preventing pseudo-absences to be less
# than 4km from an observation:

background = pseudoabsencemask(DistanceToEvent, presencelayer)
bgpoints = backgroundpoints(nodata(background, d -> d < 4), 2sum(presencelayer))

# We can take a minute to visualize the dataset, as well as the location of
# presences and pseudo-absences:

# fig-pseudoabsences
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())

scatter!(ax, presencelayer; color = :black)

# ## Setting up the model

# These steps are documented as part of the `SDeMo` documentation. The only
# difference here is that rather than passing a matrix of features and a vector
# of labels, we give a vector of layers (features), and the two layers for
# presences and absences:

sdm = SDM(MultivariateTransform{PCA}, DecisionTree, layers, presencelayer, bgpoints)

# We use a decision tree classifier, which `SDeMo` provides (admittedly in a
# rough version) out of the box.

# Out of curiosity, we can check the expected performance of the model:

folds = kfold(sdm);
cv = crossvalidate(sdm, folds; threshold = true);
mcc(cv.validation)

# We will now train the model on all the training data.

train!(sdm)

# ## Making the first prediction

# We can predict using the model by giving a vector of layers as an input. This
# will return the output *as a layer* as well:

prd = predict(sdm, layers; threshold = false)

# Decision trees, in oredr to avoid overfitting, are pretty small -- indeed, the
# default version in `SDeMo` is capped at 12 nodes, with a maximal depth of 7.
# This is because there is no limit to how much decision trees can overfit. But
# as a result, the map representing these predictions can look a little coarse:

# fig-initial-map
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Prediction (tree)")
hm = heatmap!(ax, prd; colormap = :linear_worb_100_25_c53_n256, colorrange = (0, 1))
contour!(ax, predict(sdm, layers); color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)
Colorbar(f[1, 2], hm)
lines!(ax, CHE.geometry[1]; color = :black)
hidedecorations!(ax)
hidespines!(ax)
current_figure() #hide

# In order to maintain a good predictive power with less overfitting risk, but
# with a finer outcome, we will rely on bagging.

ensemble = Bagging(sdm, 35)

# In order to further ensure that the models are learning from different parts
# of the dataset, we can also bootstrap which variables are accessible to each
# model:

bagfeatures!(ensemble)

# By default, the `bagfeatures!` function called on an ensemble will sample the variables
# forom the model, so that each model in the ensemble has the square root (rounded _up_) of
# the number of original variables.

# ::: info About this ensemble model
# 
# The model we have constructed here is essentially a random forest. Note that the PCA is
# applied *to each tree*, so it is accounting for the selection of features.
# 
# :::

# We can now train our ensemble model -- for an ensemble, this will go through
# each model, and retrain them with the correct input data/features.

train!(ensemble)

# Let's have a look at the out-of-bag error, to make sure that
# there is no grievous loss of performance:

ensemble |> outofbag |> (M) -> 1 - accuracy(M)

# Because this ensemble is a collection of model, we set the method to summarize
# all the scores as the median:

prd = predict(ensemble, layers; consensus = median, threshold = false)

# When the model is trained, we can make a prediction asking to report the
# inter-quartile range of the predictions of all models, as a measure of
# uncertainty:

unc = predict(ensemble, layers; consensus = iqr, threshold = false)

# ## Partial responses and explanations

# Like predictions, asking for a partial response or a Shapley value with a
# vector of layers will return the output as layers, with the value calculated
# for each pixel:

shap_v1 = explain(ensemble, layers, first(variables(sdm)); threshold = false, samples = 50);
