Candidate cells are weighted according to their distance to a known observation, with far away places being more likely. Depending on the distribution of distances, it may be a very good idea to flatten this layer using log or an exponent. The f function is used to determine which distance is reported (minimum by default, but can be any other relevant function).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#PseudoAbsences.pseudoabsencemask-Tuple{Type{RandomSelection}, SimpleSDMLayers.SDMLayer{Bool}}","page":"PseudoAbsences","title":"PseudoAbsences.pseudoabsencemask","text":"pseudoabsencemask(::Type{RandomSelection}, presences::SDMLayer{Bool})\n\nGenerates a mask for pseudo-absences using the random selection method.
