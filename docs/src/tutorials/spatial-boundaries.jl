# # Integration with SpatialBoundaries

# In this tutorial, we will use methods from `SpatialBoundaries`
# [Strydom2023a](@cite) to estimate boundaries for (*i.e.* patches of) wooded
# areas on the Southwestern islands of the Hawaiian Islands using landcover data
# from the EarthEnv project. The `SpatialBoundaries` package works with
# `SpeciesDistributionToolkit` through an extension, so that you can get access
# to the integration when `SpatialBoundaries` is loaded in your project:

using SpeciesDistributionToolkit
using SpatialBoundaries # [!code highlight]
using CairoMakie
using StatsBase
using Statistics
CairoMakie.activate!(; type = "png", px_per_unit = 2) #hide

# Because there are four different layers in the EarthEnv database that
# represent different types of woody cover, we will use the overall mean wombling
# value.

# First we can start by defining the extent of the Southwestern islands of
# Hawaii, which can be used to restrict the extraction of the various landcover
# layers from the EarthEnv database.

hawaii = (left = -160.2, right = -154.5, bottom = 18.6, top = 22.5)
dataprovider = RasterData(EarthEnv, LandCover)
landcover_classes = layers(dataprovider)
landcover = [SDMLayer(dataprovider; layer=class, full=true, hawaii...) for class in landcover_classes]

# We can remove all the areas that contain 100% water from the landcover data as
# our question of interest is restricted to the terrestrial realm. We do this by
# using the "Open Water" layer to mask over each of the landcover layers
# individually:

ow_index = findfirst(isequal("Open Water"), landcover_classes)
not_water = landcover[ow_index] .!== 0x64
nodata!(not_water, false)
[mask!(layer, not_water) for layer in landcover]

# As layers one through four of the EarthEnv data are concerned with data on
# woody cover (*i.e.* "Evergreen/Deciduous Needleleaf Trees", "Evergreen
# Broadleaf Trees", "Deciduous Broadleaf Trees", and "Mixed/Other Trees") we
# will work with only these layers. For a quick idea we of what the raw
# landcover data looks like we can sum these four layers and plot the total
# woody cover:

classes_with_trees = findall(contains.(landcover_classes, "Trees"))
tree_lc = convert(SDMLayer{Float64}, reduce(+, landcover[classes_with_trees]))

# Let's check that the layer looks correct:

# fig-boundaries-tree
heatmap(tree_lc; colormap=:Greens)
current_figure() #hide

# Because there are several layers, we can pass them to the wombling function
# directly, to return the mean rate and mean angular direction:

W = wombling(landcover[classes_with_trees]);

# We can get a sense of which cells are candidate boundaries, by picking the top
# 15%:

cutoff = quantile(W.rate, 0.85)
candidates = (W.rate.>=cutoff)

# We can plot these candidate points identified this way - these correspond to
# potential boundaries between low and high value area:

# fig-spbnd-candidate
heatmap(candidates, colormap=[:grey85, :black])
current_figure() #hide

# We can also look at the (log of the) rate of change - this is useful to
# pinpoint which area are likely to be identified as zones of transition:

# fig-spbnd-rate
heatmap(log1p.(W.rate))
current_figure() #hide

# For this example we will plot the direction of change as radial plots to get
# an idea of the prominent direction of change. Here we will plot *all* the
# direction values from `direction` for which the rate of change is greater than
# zero (so as to avoid denoting directions for a slope that does not exist):

direction = mask(W.direction, nodata(W.rate, 0.0))

# Because stephist() requires a vector of radians for plotting we must first
# collect the cells and convert them from degrees to radians. Then we can start
# by plotting the direction of change of *all* cells.

# fig-boundaries-polar
f = Figure()
ax = PolarAxis(f[1, 1], theta_0 = -pi/2, direction = -1)
h = fit(Histogram, deg2rad.(values(direction)); nbins = 100)
stairs!(ax, h.edges[1], h.weights[[axes(h.weights, 1)..., 1]]; color = :purple, linewidth = 2)
