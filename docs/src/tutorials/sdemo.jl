# # Use with the SDeMo package

# In this tutorial, we will reproduce [the excellent tutorial on SDMs by Damaris
# Zurell](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/), using the same species
# and location, a similar dataset, but a different algorithm.

# package!

# ## Getting the data

CHE = SpeciesDistributionToolkit.gadm("CHE");

# In order to simplify the code, we will start from a list of bioclim variables
# that have been picked to optimize the model:

bio_vars = [1, 7, 10]

# We get the data on these variables from CHELSA2:

provider = RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim)
layers = [
    SDMLayer(
        provider;
        layer = x,
        left = 0.0,
        right = 20.0,
        bottom = 35.0,
        top = 55.0,
    ) for x in bio_vars
];

# And we then clip and trim to the polygon describing Switzerland:

layers = [trim(mask!(layer, CHE)) for layer in layers];
layers = map(l -> convert(SDMLayer{Float32}, l), layers);

# The next step is to get the data, using the *eBird* dataset:

ouzel = taxon("Turdus torquatus")
presences = occurrences(
    ouzel,
    first(layers),
    "occurrenceStatus" => "PRESENT",
    "limit" => 300,
    "datasetKey" => "4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e",
)
while length(presences) < count(presences)
    occurrences!(presences)
end

# And after this, we prepare a layer with absences. Note that this code is not
# particularly beautiful but will be fixed when we release the occurrences
# interface package as part of a next version.

presencelayer = zeros(first(layers), Bool)
for occ in mask(presences, CHE)
    presencelayer[occ.longitude, occ.latitude] = true
end

# The next step is to generate a pseudo-absence mask:

background = pseudoabsencemask(DistanceToEvent, presencelayer)
bgpoints = backgroundpoints(background, sum(presencelayer))

# We can take a minute to visualize the dataset, as well as the location of
# presences and pseudo-absences:

# pashow
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())
heatmap!(ax,
    first(layers);
    colormap = :linear_bgyw_20_98_c66_n256,
)

hidespines!(ax) #hide

# ## Setting up the model

# These steps are documented as part of the `SDeMo` documentation. The only
# difference here is that rather than passing a matrix of features and a vector
# of labels, we give a vector of layers (features), and the two layers for presences and absences:

sdm = SDM(MultivariateTransform{PCA}, NaiveBayes, layers, presencelayer, bgpoints)

# Out of curiosity, we can check the expected performance of the model:

folds = kfold(sdm);
cv = crossvalidate(sdm, folds; threshold = true);
mean(mcc.(cv.validation))

# We will now train the model on all the training data:

train!(sdm)

# ## Making the first prediction

# We can predict using the model by giving a vector of layers as an input. This
# will return the output *as a layer* as well:

prd = predict(sdm, layers; threshold = false)

# To get a sense of the variability in the outcome, we will do a quick bootstrap
# aggregating with 50 different bags:

ensemble = Bagging(sdm, 50)
train!(ensemble)
unc = predict(ensemble, layers; consensus = iqr, threshold = false)

# Let's have a look at the out of bag MCC, to make sure that there is no
# grievous loss of performance:

outofbag(ensemble) |> mcc

# Because the predictions are returned as layers, we can plot them directly:

# mapshow
f = Figure(; size = (600, 600))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Prediction")
hm = heatmap!(ax, prd; colormap = :linear_worb_100_25_c53_n256, colorrange = (0, 1))

# ## Partial responses and explanations

# Like predictions, asking for a partial response or a Shapley value with a
# vector of layers will return the output as layers, with the value calculated
# for each pixel:

part_v1 = partialresponse(sdm, layers, 1; threshold = false);
shap_v1 = explain(sdm, layers, 1; threshold = false, samples = 50);

# We can confirm that these two approaches broadly agree about where the effect
# of the first variable (temperature) is leading the model to predict presences:

# explanations

ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Shapley values")
hm = heatmap!(
    ax,
    shap_v1;

# We can also get the Shapley values for *all* layers, which will return a
# vector of layers, one for each included variable:

S = explain(sdm, layers; threshold = false, samples = 100);

# We can then put this object into the `mosaic` function to get the index of
# which variable is the most important for each pixel:
