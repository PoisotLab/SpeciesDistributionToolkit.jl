# # Future climate data

# In this tutorial, we will download historical and projected future climate
# data, measure the climate novelty for each pixel, and provide a map showing
# this climate novelty.

# ## Accessing historical climate data

# As with other tutorials, we will define a bounding box encompassing out region
# of interest:

spatial_extent = (left = 8.412, bottom = 41.325, right = 9.662, top = 43.060)

# We will get the [BioClim data from CHELSA v1](/datasets/CHELSA1/BioClim).
# CHELSA v1 offers access to the 19 original bioclim variable, and their
# projection under a variety of CMIP5 models/scenarios. These are pretty large
# data, and so this operation may take a while in terms of download/read time.
# The first time you run this command will download the data, and the next calls
# will read them from disk.

dataprovider = RasterData(CHELSA1, BioClim)

# We can search the layer that correspond to annual precipitation and annual
# mean temperature in the list of provided layers:

layers_code = findall(
    v -> contains(v, "Annual Mean Temperature") | contains(v, "Annual Precipitation"),
    layerdescriptions(dataprovider),
)

# The first step is quite simply to grab the reference state for the
# annual precipitation, by specifying the layer and the spatial extent:

historical = [SDMLayer(dataprovider; layer=l, spatial_extent...) for l in layers_code]

# We can have a little look at this dataset by checking the density of the values
# for the first layer (we can pass a layer to a Makie function directly):

hist(
    historical[1]; color = (:grey, 0.5),
    figure = (; size = (800, 300)),
    axis = (; xlabel = layerdescriptions(dataprovider)[layers_code[1]]),
    bins = 100,
)
current_figure() #hide

# ## Accessing future climate data

# In the next step, we will download the projected climate data under RCP26. This
# requires setting up a projection object, which is composed of a scenario and a
# model. This information is used by the package to verify that this combination
# exists within the dataset we are working with.

projection = Projection(RCP85, IPSL_CM5A_MR)

# Future data are available for different years, so we will take a look at what
# years are available:

available_timeperiods = SimpleSDMDatasets.timespans(dataprovider, projection)

# If we do not specify an argument, the data retrieved will be the ones for the
# closest timespan. Getting the projected temperature is the *same* call as
# before, except we now pass an additional argument -- the projection.

projected = [SDMLayer(
    dataprovider,
    projection;
    layer=l,
    spatial_extent...,
    timespan = last(available_timeperiods),
) for l in layers_code]

# ## Re-scaling the variables

# In order to compare the variables, we will first re-scale them so that they
# have mean zero and unit variance. More accurately, because we want to
# *compare* the historical and projected data, we will use the mean and standard
# deviation of the historical data as the baseline:

μ = mean.(historical)
σ = std.(historical)

#-

cr_historical = (historical .- μ) ./ σ
cr_projected = (projected .- μ) ./ σ

# ## Measuring climate novelty

# We will use a simple measure of climate novelty, which is defined as the
# smallest Euclidean distance between a cell in the raster and all the possible
# cells in the future raster.

# To have a way to store the results, we will start by making a copy of one of
# the input rasters:

Δclim = similar(cr_historical[1])

# And then, we can loop over the positions to find the minimum distance:

for position in keys(cr_historical[1])
    dtemp = (cr_historical[1][position] .- values(cr_projected[1])).^2.0
    dprec = (cr_historical[2][position] .- values(cr_projected[2])).^2.0
    Δclim[position] = minimum(sqrt.(dtemp .+ dprec))
end

# Because we have stored this information directly inside the raster, we can
# plot it:

fig, ax, hm = heatmap(
    Δclim;
    colormap = :lipari,
    figure = (; size = (800, 400)),
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()),
)
Colorbar(fig[:, end + 1], hm)
current_figure() #hide
