    provides(::Type{P}, ::Type{D}) where {P <: RasterProvider, D <: RasterDataset}

This is the core function upon which the entire interface is built. Its purpose
is to specify whether a specific dataset is provided by a specific provider.
Note that this function takes two arguments, as opposed to a `RasterData`
argument, because it is called in the *inner* constructor of `RasterData`: you
cannot instantiate a `RasterData` with an incompatible provider/dataset
combination.

The default value of this function is `false`, and to allow the use of a dataset
with a provider, it is *required* to overload it for this specific pair so that
it returns `true`.
"""
provides(::Type{P}, ::Type{D}) where {P <: RasterProvider, D <: RasterDataset} = false

"""
    provides(::R, ::F) where {R <: RasterData, F <: Future}

This method for `provides` specifies whether a `RasterData` combination has
support for the value of the `Future` (a combination of a `FutureScenario` and a
`FutureModel`) given as the second argument. Note that this function is not
called as part of the `Future` constructor (because models and scenarios are
messy *and* dataset dependent), but is still called when requesting data.

The default value of this function is `false`, and to allow the use of a future
dataset with a given provider, it is *required* to overload it so that it
returns `true`.

"""
    downloadtype(::R) where {R <: RasterData}

This method returns a `RasterDownloadType` that is used *internally* to be more
explicit about the type of object that is downloaded from the raster source. The
supported values are `_file` (the default, which is an ascii, geotiff, NetCDF,
etc. single file), and `_zip` (a zip archive containing files). This is a trait
because we *cannot* trust file extensions.
"""
downloadtype(::R) where {R <: RasterData} = _file

"""
    downloadtype(data::R, ::F) where {R <: RasterData, F <: Future}

This method provides the type of the downloaded object for a combination of a
raster source and a future scenario as a `RasterDownloadType`.

If no overload is given, this will default to `downloadtype(data)`, as we can
assume that the type of downloaded object is the same for both current and
future scenarios.

"""
    filetype(::R) where {R <: RasterData}

This method returns a `RasterFileType` that represents the format of the raster
data. `RasterFileType` is an enumerated type. This overload is particularly
important as it will determine how the returned file path should be read.

The default value is `_tiff`.

that the raster format is the same for both current and future scenarios.

    resolutions(::R) where {R <: RasterData}

This method controls whether the dataset has a *resolution*, *i.e.* a grid size.
If this is `nothing` (the default), it means that the dataset is only given at a
set resolution.

An overload of this method is *required* when there are multiple resolutions
available, and *must* return a `Dict` with numeric keys (for the resolution) and
string values (giving the textual representation of these keys, usually in the
way that is usable to build the url).

Any dataset with a return value that is not `nothing` *must* accept the
`resolution` keyword.

This method controls whether the dataset has monthly layers. If this is

available, and *must* return a `Vector{Dates.Month}`.

This method controls whether the dataset has named layers. If this is `nothing`
(the default), it means that the dataset will have a single layer.

An overload of this method is *required* when there are multiple layers
available, and *must* return a `Vector`, usually of `String`. Note that by
default, the layers can also be accessed by using an `Integer`, in which case
`layer=i` will be the *i*-th entry in `layers(data)`.

This method controls whether the dataset has additional keys. If this is

the default keys specified in this interface.

needed to access the data (*e.g.* `full=true` for the `EarthEnv` land-cover
data), and *must* return a `Dict`, with `Symbol` keys and `Tuple` arguments,
where the key is the keyword argument passed to `downloader` and the tuple lists
