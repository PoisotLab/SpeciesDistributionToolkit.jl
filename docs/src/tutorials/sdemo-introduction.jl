# # Training SDMs with SDeMo

# The purpose of this vignette is to take a whistle-stop tour of the what the
# package has to offer. We will see how to train a model, cross-validate it,
# select variables, tune hyper-parameters, use bootstraping to measure
# uncertainty, show partial response curves, calculate varialble importances
# through bootstraping and Shapley values, and generate counterfactual inputs.

# ::: tip Mapping the outputs
#
# The functions to interact with raster data, and present the outputs of models as maps, are
# implemented as part of `SpeciesDistributionToolkit` (`SDT`). There is a follow-up tutorial
# that focuses on visualisation of SDM outputs.
#
# :::

# This vignette is *very terse* and is not an introduction to using or
# interpreting these models!

# ## Setting up the environment

# The package comes with a series of demonstration data, that represent the
# presences and absences of *Sitta whiteheadi* at about 1500 locations in
# Corsica, with 19 bioclim environmental variables:

X, y = SDeMo.__demodata()
size(X)

# ## Setting up the model

# We will start with an initial model that uses a PCA to transform the data, and
# then a Naive Bayes Classifier for the classification. Note that this is the
# partial syntax where we use the default threshold, and all the variables:

sdm = SDM(MultivariateTransform{PCA}, NaiveBayes, X, y)

# ::: warning Transformations
# 
# The transformations will by default *only* account for the presences. This is motivated by
# the fact that absences will often be pseudo-absences, and therefore should not be used to
# transform the data. There are ways to use absences to transform the data as well, which
# are presented in the `SDeMo` manual.
#
# :::

# ## Initial cross-validation

# Throughout this demonstration, we will use the same splits between validation
# and training data, with 10 folds:

folds = kfold(sdm; k = 10);

# Using the same splits is important because it will provide a fair basis of comparison for
# the different models.

# Before starting any manipulation, we can start cross-validating the model:
# this will return a named tuple with the confusion matrices for validation and
# training data:

cv = crossvalidate(sdm, folds);

# The reason why we return the confusion matrices as opposed to directly
# measuring statistics is that we have more freedom to manipulate the data,
# without needing to re-run the analysis. For example, we can get the average of
# a handful of measures on this first step of cross validation:

measures = [mcc, balancedaccuracy, ppv, npv, trueskill, markedness]
cvresult = [measure(set) for measure in measures, set in cv]
pretty_table(
    hcat(string.(measures), cvresult);

# By default, calling a function to measure model performance (the full list is in the
# manual) on a series of confusion matrices will return the average. Adding the `true` argument returns a tuple with the 95% CI:

mcc(cv.validation, true)

# If we want to get a simple idea of what the MCC is for the validation
# data for all folds, we can use:

mcc.(cv.validation)

# The associated confidence interval is

ci(cv.validation, mcc)

# Note that cross-validation *does not* train the model. This is meant to convey the idea
# that cross-validation is letting us know whether the model is good enough to be trained.
# If we want to forgo variable selection, we can train the model with

train!(sdm)

# ## Variable selection

# We will now select variables using forward selection, but with the added
# constraint that the first variable (annual mean temperature) must be included:

forwardselection!(sdm, folds, [1])

# This operation *will retrain* the model. We can now look at the list of
# selected variables:

variables(sdm)

# Is this making a difference in terms of cross-validation?

# Quite clearly! Before thinking about the relative importance of variables, we
# will take a look at the thresold.

# ## Moving threshold classification

# The `crossvalidate` function comes with an optional argument to specify the
# threshold between a positive and negative outcome. We can use this to figure
# out the best possible threshold:

thresholds = LinRange(0.01, 0.99, 200)
cv3 = [crossvalidate(sdm, folds; thr = t) for t in thresholds];

# We can plot the simplified version of this analysis (averaged across all folds
# for each value of the threshold):

# fig-sdemo-tuning
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = 1, xlabel = "Threshold", ylabel = "MCC")
scatter!(ax, thresholds, [mean(mcc.(s.validation)) for s in cv3])
ax2 = Axis(f[1, 2]; aspect = 1, xlabel = "Precision", ylabel = "Recall")
scatter!(
    ax2,
    [mean(SDeMo.precision.(s.validation)) for s in cv3],
    [mean(SDeMo.recall.(s.validation)) for s in cv3],
)
xlims!(ax, 0.0, 1.0)
ylims!(ax, 0.0, 1.0)
xlims!(ax2, 0.0, 1.0)
ylims!(ax2, 0.0, 1.0)
current_figure() #hide

# For reference, the threshold at the end of this process is:

threshold(sdm)

# ## Variable importance

# We can evaluate the importance of each variable by bootstrap, where the values
# of this variable are randomized, and the absolute value of the difference in
# model performance is returned (averaged across all folds):

varimp = variableimportance(sdm, folds)

# In relative terms, this is:

pretty_table(
    hcat(variables(sdm), varimp ./ sum(varimp));

# ## Partial response curve

# Another way to look at the effect of variables is to use the partial response
# curves. For example, we can look at the predictions of the model between 5 and
# 15 degrees:

prx, pry = partialresponse(sdm, 1, LinRange(5.0, 15.0, 100); threshold = false);

# Note that we use `threshold=false` to make sure that we look at the score that
# is returned by the classifier, and not the thresholded version.

# fig-partialrespo-bio1
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; xlabel = "BIO1", ylabel = "Partial response")
lines!(ax, prx, pry; color = :black)
hlines!(ax, [threshold(sdm)]; color = :red, linestyle = :dash)
current_figure() #hide

# We can also show the response surface using two variables:

prx, pry, prz = partialresponse(sdm, variables(sdm)[1:2]..., (100, 100); threshold = false);

# Note that the last element returned in this case is a two-dimensional array, as it makes
# sense to visualize the result as a heatmap. Although the idea of a the partial response
# curves generalizes to more than two dimensions, it is not supported by the package.

# fig-partialresp-surface
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; xlabel = "BIO$(variables(sdm)[1])", ylabel = "BIO$(variables(sdm)[2])")
cm = heatmap!(prx, pry, prz; colormap = :Oranges)
Colorbar(f[1, 2], cm)
current_figure() #hide

# ## Inflated partial responses

# Inflated partial responses replace the average value by other values drawn from different
# quantiles of the variables:

# fig-inflated-curve
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1])
prx, pry = partialresponse(sdm, 1; inflated = false, threshold = false)
for i in 1:200
<<<<<<< HEAD:SDeMo/docs/src/demo.jl
    ix, iy = partialresponse(sdm, 1; inflated=true, threshold=false)
    lines!(ax, ix, iy, color=(:grey, 0.5))
=======
    ix, iy = partialresponse(sdm, 1; inflated = true, threshold = false)
    lines!(ax, ix, iy; color = (:grey, 0.5))
>>>>>>> 1614b5cad4fbc0eed0475959d4cd93bddfa312bd:docs/src/tutorials/sdemo-introduction.jl
end
lines!(ax, prx, pry; color = :black, linewidth = 4)
current_figure() #hide

# ## Measuring uncertainty with bagging

# We can wrap our model into an homogeneous ensemble:

ensemble = Bagging(sdm, 20)
train!(ensemble)

# Ensemble models can be used in the same way as regular models, but take an
# extra keyword `consensus` to indicate how the results from each model should
# be reconciled. By default, this is the `median`, but for uncertainty, `iqr` is
# a great choice. Note that we use `threshold=false` because we want to look at
# the distribution of the score, not the boolean output:

uncert = predict(ensemble; consensus = iqr, threshold = false);

# fig-uncert-hist
hist(uncert; color = :grey, axis = (; xlabel = "Uncertainty (IQR)"))
current_figure() #hide

# ## Heterogeneous ensembles

# We can setup an heterogeneous ensemble model by passing several SDMs to
# `Ensemble`:

m1 = SDM(MultivariateTransform{PCA}, NaiveBayes, X, y)
m2 = SDM(RawData, BIOCLIM, X, y)
m3 = SDM(MultivariateTransform{PCA}, BIOCLIM, X, y)
variables!(m2, [1, 12])
hm = Ensemble(m1, m2, m3)

# We can train this model in the same way:

train!(hm)

# And get predictions:

predict(hm; consensus = median, threshold = false)[1:10]

# Note that the ensemble models (`Bagging` and `Ensemble`) are supported by the `explain`,
# `partialresponse`, and `counterfactual` functions.

# ## Explaining predictions

# We can perform the (MCMC version of) Shapley values measurement, using the
# `explain` method:

[explain(sdm, v; observation = 3) for v in variables(sdm)]

# These values are returned as the effect of this variable's value on the
# average prediction for this observation.

# We can also produce a figure that looks like the partial response curve, by
# showing the effect on a variable on each training instance:

# fig-bio1-effect-map
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; xlabel = "BIO1", ylabel = "Effect on the average prediction")
scatter!(ax, features(sdm, 1), explain(sdm, 1; threshold = true); color = :purple)
current_figure() #hide

# ## Counterfactuals

# In the final example, we will focus on generating a counterfactual input,
# *i.e.* a set of hypothetical inputs that lead the model to predicting the
# other outcome. Internally, candidate points are generated using the
# Nelder-Mead algorithm, which works well enough but is not compatible with
# categorical data.

# We will pick one prediction to flip:

inst = 4

# And look at its outcome:

outcome = predict(sdm)[inst]

# Our target is expressed in terms of the score we want the counterfactual to
# reach (and not in terms of true/false, this is very important):

target = outcome ? 0.9threshold(sdm) : 1.1threshold(sdm)

# The actual counterfactual is generated as:

cf = counterfactual(
    sdm,
    instance(sdm, inst; strict = false),
    target,
    200.0;
    threshold = false,
)

# The last value (set to `200.0` here) is the learning rate, which usually needs
# to be tuned. The countefactual input for the observation we are interested in
# is:

pretty_table(
    hcat(variables(sdm), instance(sdm, inst), cf[variables(sdm)]);

# This vignette offered a very quick overview of what the `SDeMo` package does.
