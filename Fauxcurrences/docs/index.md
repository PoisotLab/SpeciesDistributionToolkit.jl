# Fauxcurrences.jl

This package is a *clean-room*, *feature-equivalent* re-write in Julia of most
of the functionalities of the [`fauxcurrence` package for R][paper]. The
original code is licensed under the GPL, and this package is licensed under
the MIT. For this reason, the original code, and any document distributed with
it, has not been consulted during the implementation; the work is entirely
based on the published article. As detailed in the following sections, the two
packages do not have *feature parity*, but there is an overlap in the most
significant functions.

## Why?

Interoperability: this package uses `SimpleSDMLayers`, `Distances`, and `GBIF`
as backends, making it fit very snuggly with the rest of the (Eco)Julia
ecosystem, and working towards integration of tools to build SDMs at scale.

Expandability: the package is built on modular functions, to ensure that
custom workflows can be built, while maintaining a general interface.

Performance: by relying on pre-allocated matrices, the operations are fairly
fast. Whenever a point changes, only the matrices that are impacted are
updated, which results in notable improvements for more taxa.

Licensing: the package uses the more permissive MIT license, imposing fewer
constraints on contributors.

## Overview of methods

Note that *none* of the methods are exported, so they need to be called with
`Fauxcurrences.method_name`. These methods are the ones that users will need to
call to set-up a whole run of the pipeline.

## Anatomy of a `Fauxcurrences`  run

**Step 0**. Prepare the run - the minimal ingredients are a set of coordinates
(for example using the `GBIF.jl` package), and a layer (one of the
`SimpleSDMLayer` types, predictor or response does not matter).

````julia
using Fauxcurrences
using SimpleSDMLayers
using GBIF
````

````julia
import Random
Random.seed!(616525434012345)
````

````
Random.TaskLocalRNG()
````

### Prepare the occurence data

Get the observation data in the correct format, which is an array of matrices
with two rows (longitude, latitude) and one column for observed occurrence.
This is usually an array of GBIF observations, but all that matters is that
this is a matrix with longitudes in the first row, and latitudes in the second
row. The matrix *has* to be column-major, with observations as columns. To
make sure that we cover a reasonable spatial extent, we will look at the
default (small) raster distributed with `SimpleSDMLayers`.

````julia
layer = geotiff(SimpleSDMPredictor, joinpath(dirname(pathof(SimpleSDMLayers)), "..", "data", "connectivity.tiff"))
````

````
SDM predictor → 1255×1205 grid with 863533 Float32-valued cells
  Latitudes	45.34523 ⇢ 47.38457
  Longitudes	-75.17734 ⇢ -72.36719207296848
````

This covers a small area in the Laurentians, north of Montréal, so looking for
racoons, deers, and white-footed mice is a safe bet:

````julia
taxa = taxon.(["Procyon lotor", "Odocoileus virginianus", "Peromyscus leucopus"])

observations = [occurrences(t,
    "hasCoordinate" => "true",
    "decimalLatitude" => extrema(latitudes(layer)),
    "decimalLongitude" => extrema(longitudes(layer)),
    "limit" => 100) for t in taxa]
````

````
3-element Vector{GBIF.GBIFRecords}:
 GBIF records: downloaded 100 out of 368

 GBIF records: downloaded 100 out of 799

 GBIF records: downloaded 41 out of 41

````

The last step is to turn these occurrences into a matrix of latitudes and
longitudes:

````julia
obs = [Fauxcurrences.get_valid_coordinates(o, layer) for o in observations]
````

### Parameters for the run

Decide on the number of points to generate, and the weight matrix. The number
of points to generate is, by default, the number of observations in the
original dataset, but this can be changed to generate balanced samples:

````julia
points_to_generate = fill(30, length(obs))
````

````
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 30
 30
 30
````

The weight matrix is used to determine whether intra or inter-specific
distances are more important in the distribution score. For example, this will
set up a scoring scheme where intra-specific distances count for 75% of the
total. The only constraint is that the matrix `W` *must* sum to 1, which is
enforced by the code internally:

````julia
W = Fauxcurrences.weighted_components(length(obs), 0.75)
````

````
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.25  0.0833333  0.0833333
 0.0   0.25       0.0833333
 0.0   0.0        0.25
````

### Pre-allocate the objects

This is an important part of the run, as `Fauxcurrences` is built to *not*
allocate more memory than needed. As such, these objects are going to be
re-written many, many times. The upside is that, if this steps fits in your
memory, the entire workflow will also fit in your memory.

````julia
obs_intra, obs_inter, sim_intra, sim_inter = Fauxcurrences.preallocate_distance_matrices(obs; samples=points_to_generate);
````

The entire workflow is designed to use multiple species (as most relevant
questions will require multiple species). Using a single-species approach only
required to pass `[obs]` as opposed to `obs`.

### Measure the intra and inter-specific distances

This is an important step as *all generated points* will maintain the upper
bounds of these distances matrices, *even if the inter-specific distance are
weightless*.

````julia
Fauxcurrences.measure_intraspecific_distances!(obs_intra, obs);
Fauxcurrences.measure_interspecific_distances!(obs_inter, obs);
````

### Bootstrap the initial set of points

This is a two-step process, involving first the pre-allocation of coordinate
matrices, and second the population of these matrices using random points.

````julia
sim = Fauxcurrences.preallocate_simulated_points(obs; samples=points_to_generate);
````

The actual bootstrapping can be a little longer:

````julia
Fauxcurrences.bootstrap!(sim, layer, obs, obs_intra, obs_inter, sim_intra, sim_inter);
````

### Bin the distance matrices

This is to prepare the scoring of the initial solution. Note that the package
will *never* allow points in the simulated occurrences to create a distance
matrix where the maximum distance is larger than the maximum distance in the
empirical matrix.

````julia
bin_intra = [Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(obs_intra[i], maximum(obs_intra[i])) for i in 1:length(obs_intra)];
bin_inter = [Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(obs_inter[i], maximum(obs_inter[i])) for i in 1:length(obs_inter)];
bin_s_intra = [Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(sim_intra[i], maximum(obs_intra[i])) for i in 1:length(obs_intra)];
bin_s_inter = [Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(sim_inter[i], maximum(obs_inter[i])) for i in 1:length(obs_inter)];
````

This version of the `_bin_distribution` function is allocating an array for
the bins, but the internal function is over-writing it, to avoid unwanted
allocations.

### Measure the initial divergence

This will be the starting point between the observed and simulated
distributions, and the score that we want to improve. Note that it accounts
for the weights in the matrix. This step will return a vector, the sum of
which is the total divergence between the matrices.

````julia
D = Fauxcurrences.score_distributions(W, bin_intra, bin_s_intra, bin_inter, bin_s_inter)
````

````
6-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.08352051225167792
 0.023587420165084763
 0.11066876505627615
 0.0314278095584371
 0.03554438672171188
 0.11445125913584189
````

### Setup the actual run

This step has infinitely many variations, as `Fauxcurrences` only offers a
method to do *a single step forward*. In most cases, using *e.g.*
`ProgressMeter` will be a good way to track the progress of the run, and to
allow, for example, to stop it when a condition of criteria (absolute/relative
divergence, globally, on average, or per-species) are met. For the sake of
simplicity, we return the sum of all divergences, measures for 500000
timesteps.

````julia
progress = zeros(Float64, 500_000)
progress[1] = sum(D)
````

````
0.39920015288902977
````

### Run!

The `step!` function takes most of what we have allocated so far, which is a
lot, but allows considerable performance gains. The last argument to `step!`
is the current divergence, and the return value of `step!` (in addition to
modifying the simulated points) is the new divergence.

Before running the actual loop, it is a good idea to time a handful of steps?
Why a handful? Because Julia do be compiling, and because depending on the
structure of your points, the problem might be more or less difficult to
solve. In practice, using `ProgressMeter` will make the timing of the whole
process a lot more informative. In this simple version, we rely on a manually
created progress report:

````julia
for i in 2:length(progress)
    progress[i] = Fauxcurrences.step!(sim, layer, W, obs_intra, obs_inter, sim_intra, sim_inter, bin_intra, bin_inter, bin_s_intra, bin_s_inter, progress[i-1])
    if iszero(i%20_000)
        println("[$(lpad(100*round(Int64, i/length(progress)), 3))%]\tJS-divergence: $(round(progress[i]; digits=3))")
    end
end
````

````

````

The call to `step!` is... lengthy. The reason for this is very simple: `step!`
will update as much information as it can *in place* when a change is made.
This means that there are no objects creates (only changed), but the downside
is that the function needs to be given a lot of information.

### Congratulations, your run is done!

Here, it would make sense to look at the total improvement (or to plot the
timeseries of the improvement):

````julia
println("Improvement: $(round(progress[begin]/progress[end]; digits=2)) ×")
````

````
Improvement: 2.23 ×

````

Note that for a small number of iterations (like we used here), this
improvement is unlikely to be very large; note also that the returns (in terms
of improvement over time) are very much diminishing.

You can also look at the per-matrix score, out of all the distance bins (set
as a package-wide variable, `Fauxcurrences._number_of_bins`, which you are
encouraged to tweak) -- under a *good* fit, the lines in `bin_intra` and
`bin_s_intra` would overlap (same with `..._inter`).

## Suspected and known changes to the original package

The changes are classified by whether or not we **KNOW** or **SUSPECT** a
change, and further by whether the change is a **difference** (the two
packages do things differently), a **removal** (features from `fauxcurrence`
have not been ported), or an **addition** (`Fauxcurrences.jl` has unique
features). Note that because the maintainers of the two packages *do* chat,
this list may not be entirely up to date, and there has been exchange of ideas
and features already.

**KNOWN/difference** The distance between distribution is measured using the
square root of the ranged Jensen-Shannon divergence (the original package uses
the Kullback-Leibler divergence) - this measure gives a value in 0-1 *and* is
a true metric. The JS distance is symmetrical for any two distributions, but
more importantly, never returns an infinite value when one density is 0 and
the other is not. For sparse datasets and/or clumped occurrences, this means
that JS will return a value that can still be compared by the optimizer. Note
also that for a JS distance of x, the equivalent KL divergence would be of the
order of x². Using JS distance has the notable advantage of allowing to use an
upper-triangular matrix for weights, which speeds up calculations
significantly. Future releases of the package might allow complete matrices,
but for the moment, these seem to require more guesses about the parameters
than we are comfortable with.

**KNOWN/addition** The number of points to simulate can be fixed *per species*
- this is important because we may want to benchmark algorithms under the
unrealistic assumption that the sampling effort is the same. It also allows
users to generate smaller samples of simulated points, which is useful if some
species have a lot of occurrences.

**KNOWN/removal** The bootstrap phase (generation of the initial null) picks
distances from the distance matrix, rather than performing an estimation of
the underlying distribution. This is mostly because the points will be refined
anyways, so the faster solution was selected, and because performing a kernel
approximation sometimes smoothed out ecologically relevant structure in the
data (notably archipelagos, or grid-based sampling).

**SUSPECTED/difference** The constraints on simulated points are as follow:
the intra-specific distance cannot be larger than the observed intra-specific
distance, and the inter-specific distance cannot be larger than the observed
pairwise inter-specific distance. This is motivated by two reasons. First,
this makes the binning of the distributions a lot more stable, as the upport
bound of the distribution remains the same. Second, this ensures that the
optimizer does not "cheat" by over-expanding the simulated points.

**SUSPECTED/difference** During optimization, the *only* criteria that is
checked is that the average of all divergences (intra-specific and pairwise
inter-specific) must decrease; this can result in *increases* of the distance
for one or more of the component distributions. There is no indication in the
original manuscript of what constitutes an acceptable move, and the clean-room
re-implementation means that the code was not consulted. This is scheduled to
be a change in future versions of the package, likely using a `strict` keyword
to decide whether all divergences need to decrease for the move to be
considered valid.

**KNOWN/removal** `Fauxcurrences.jl` does not offer non-pairwsie
inter-specific distances. This is a direct consequence of the next point,
which is one of the most significant additions to the package.

**KNOWN/addition** `Fauxcurrences.jl` offers the ability to weigh the
different matrices (intra v. inter). In the default configuration, all
*matrices* have the same weight. An alternative calibration scheme is to give
an equivalent weight to the sum of the *n* intra-specific matrices, and of the
*n(n-1)/2* inter-specific matrices. Additional calibrations can reflect other
biological constraints. This addition is important because in the case of
multiple species, the pairwise inter-specific distances can rapidly dominate
the overall score. The ability to set a weight matrix can lead to, for
example, starting the null model with only the intra-specific matrices, and
then optimizing the inter-specific matrices.

**KNOWN/difference** `Faucurrences.jl` does not generate distribution of
*raster cells*, and is focused on *observations*. This has been motivated by
our use-cases where rasters can have different spatial resolutions. Generating
occurrences is a little bit more computationally expensive, but the memory
footprint has been optimized and the code is rapid enough that downscaling the
data prior to generation was not identified as a requirement.

**KNOWN/difference** By default, `Fauxcurrences.jl` uses the Haversine
distance for both the evaluation of distance matrices and the generation of
new points. This decision was taken because (i) the Haversine distance is
probably a good enough approximation given the possible measurement error,
sampling biases, and raster resolution, and (ii) the first geodetic problem
can be solved in a very computationally efficient way for this distance,
speeding up the generation of new points significantly. Do note that generated
points are *guaranteed* to lay on a valued cell of the layer given as a
template.
