This function loops through all records, and applies the filters to it. Filters
are built-in or user-defined functions that return `true` when the record
needs to be kept, and `false` when it needs to be discarded.

It is important to note that the records are *not actually removed*: they
are masked from user view. This means that you can try different filtering
strategies without having to re-query GBIF.
