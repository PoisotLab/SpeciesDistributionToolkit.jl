# SpeciesDistributionToolkit

üó∫Ô∏è `SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl` is a collection of Julia packages forming a
toolkit meant to deal with (surprise!) species distribution data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All of the packages are installed automatically, so you can simply do
> `import Pkg; Pkd.add("SpeciesDistributionToolkit")` and get started.

Specifically, the goal of these packages put together is to provide a consistent way to handle
occurrence data, put them on a map, and make it interact with environmental
information. 

> [!TIP]
> There is a manuscript describing this package, currently available as a preprint:  
> Poisot, T., Bussi√®res-Fournel, A., Dansereau, G., and Catchen, M. D. (2025). A Julia toolkit for species distribution data. EcoEvoRxiv. doi: [10.32942/X2405R](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/8582/)

quick reference, and links to the documentation for all methods in the component
packages.
