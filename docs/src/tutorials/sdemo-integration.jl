# # Using SDeMo with other packages

# In this tutorial, we will work on the same species and location as in [the
# excellent tutorial on SDMs by Damaris
# Zurell](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/), to show how
# `SpeciesDistributionToolkit` integrates prediction to the rest of the
# workflow.

# Note that there are several sections about the `SDeMo` package in the "How-to"
# section of the manual.

# ## Getting the data

CHE = getpolygon(PolygonData(OpenStreetMap, Places), place="Switzerland") 

# In order to simplify the code, we will start from a list of bioclim variables
# that have been picked to optimize the model - `SDeMo` offers many functions
# for variable selection.

bio_vars = [1, 11, 5, 8, 6]

# We get the data on these variables from CHELSA2:

provider = RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim)
L = SDMLayer{Float32}[
    SDMLayer(
        provider;
        layer = x,
        SpeciesDistributionToolkit.boundingbox(CHE)...,
    ) for x in bio_vars
];

# And we then clip and trim to the polygon describing Switzerland:

mask!(L, CHE)

# The next step is to get the data, using the *eBird* dataset:

ouzel = taxon("Turdus torquatus")
presences = occurrences(
    ouzel,
    first(L),
    "occurrenceStatus" => "PRESENT",
    "limit" => 300,
    "datasetKey" => "4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e",
)
while length(presences) < count(presences)
    occurrences!(presences)
end

# And after this, we prepare a layer with presence data:

presencelayer = mask(first(L), Occurrences(mask(presences, CHE)))

# The next step is to generate a pseudo-absence mask. We will sample based on
# the distance to an observation, by also preventing pseudo-absences to be less
# than 4km from an observation:

background = pseudoabsencemask(DistanceToEvent, presencelayer)
bgpoints = backgroundpoints(nodata(background, d -> d < 4), 2sum(presencelayer))

# We can take a minute to visualize the dataset, as well as the location of
# presences and pseudo-absences:

# fig-pseudoabsences
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())

scatter!(ax, presencelayer; color = :black)
scatter!(ax, bgpoints; color = :red, markersize = 4)
hidedecorations!(ax)
hidespines!(ax)

# ## Setting up the model

# These steps are documented as part of the `SDeMo` documentation. The only
# difference here is that rather than passing a matrix of features and a vector
# of labels, we give a vector of layers (features), and the two layers for
# presences and absences:

sdm = SDM(ZScore, Logistic, L, presencelayer, bgpoints)
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm), :Î·, 1e-4);
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm), :interactions, :all);
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm), :epochs, 10_000);

# We will now train the model on all the training data.

train!(sdm)

# ## Making the first prediction

# We can predict using the model by giving a vector of layers as an input. This
# will return the output *as a layer* as well:

prd = predict(sdm, L; threshold = false)

# Because this prediction is a layer, we can plot it directly:

# fig-initial-map
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())
hm = heatmap!(ax, prd; colormap = :linear_worb_100_25_c53_n256, colorrange = (0, 1))
contour!(ax, predict(sdm, L); color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)
Colorbar(f[1, 2], hm)
lines!(ax, CHE; color = :black)
hidedecorations!(ax)
hidespines!(ax)
current_figure() #hide

# As a rule, most relevant function in `SDeMo` will, when given layers as an
# argument, return the output as layers:

partial1 = partialresponse(sdm, L, 1; threshold=false)

# The output can be visualised as well. Partial responses are given in the same
# units as the prediction.

# fig-partial-resp
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())
hm = heatmap!(ax, partial1; colormap = :tempo, colorrange = (0, 1))
contour!(ax, predict(sdm, L); color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)
Colorbar(f[1, 2], hm)
lines!(ax, CHE; color = :black)
hidedecorations!(ax)
hidespines!(ax)
current_figure() #hide

# This, naturally, is also true for Shapley values:

shapley1 = explain(sdm, L, 1; threshold=false)

# Note that the Shapley values are expressed as a deviation from the average
# prediction, and so positive values correspond to the presence class being more
# likely.

# Both the `explain` and `partialresponse` functions can accept keywords that
# are passed to `predict` - in this tutorial, we use `threshold=false` to
# provide an explanation on the score returned by the model, but we can also
# request an explanation of the binary response (this is usually less
# informative).

# fig-shapley-resp
col_lims = maximum(abs.(quantile(shapley1, [0.1, 0.9]))).*(-1, 1)
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())
hm = heatmap!(ax, shapley1; colormap = :roma, colorrange = col_lims)
contour!(ax, predict(sdm, L); color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)

# When given a vector of layers, the `explain` function will return a layer with
# the explanation for each input variable:

S = explain(sdm, L; threshold=false)

# We can then put this object into the `mosaic` function to get the index of
# which variable is the most important for each pixel:

# fig-sdm-mosaicplot
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
mostimp = mosaic(argmax, map(x -> abs.(x), S))
