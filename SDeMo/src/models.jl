    SDM

This type specifies a *full* model, which is composed of a transformer (which
applies a transformation on the data), a classifier (which returns a
quantitative score), a threshold (above which the score corresponds to the
prediction of a presence).

In addition, the SDM carries with it the training features and labels, as well
as a vector of indices indicating which variables are actually used by the
model.

This returns the value above which the score returned by the SDM is considered
to be a presence.

"""
    features(sdm::SDM)

Returns the features stored in the field `X` of the SDM. Note that the features
are an array, and this does not return a copy of it -- any change made to the
output of this function *will* change the content of the SDM features.

Returns the labels stored in the field `y` of the SDM -- note that this is not a
copy of the labels, but the object itself.

"""
    variables(sdm::SDM)

Returns the list of variables used by the SDM -- these *may* be ordered by
importance. This does not return a copy of the variables array, but the array
itself.
