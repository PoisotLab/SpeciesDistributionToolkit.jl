"""
    reclassify(L::SDMLayer, rules::Pair...)

Returns a layer where the cells are updated as a function of rules, given as
`(function) => value`, where the function must return a `Bool` value. For
example, `reclassify(layer, (x -> abs(x)<=1)=>true)` will set a value of `true`
to all cells with values in -1;1, and maks all other cells. You can use multiple
rules, in which case they are applied sequentially (a later rule can overwrite
an earlier one).
