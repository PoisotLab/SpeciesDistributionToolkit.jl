# How-to

This section of the manual presents "How-tos", short capsules about getting you to achieve
a simple, well-defined task. Although there is some discussion of design elements for the
various packages, this is *not* the documentation; instead, you can think of this section as
a collection of snippets to copy and paste to build your own analysis.

::: tip To get the most out of the how-tos...

... it is a good idea to have an idea of what type of operation you want to perform. You may
find some inspiration in the "Tutorials" section of the manual. For more information about
all arguments, refer to the "Reference" section.

:::

Several "How-to" pages end with a list of documentation of the most important functions
used. This is not intended to replace the "Reference" section of the manual, but instead to
give you a quick reference for core operations.

If you have a question about how to achieve a specific task, feel free to [share it](https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl/discussions/categories/ideas) in the Discussion page, so we can turn it into a How to!
