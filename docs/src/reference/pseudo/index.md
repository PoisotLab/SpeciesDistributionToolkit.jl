## Generation of a pseudo-absence mask

The above algorithms are used in conjunction with `pseudoabsencemask` to
generate a Boolean layer that contains all pixels in which a background point
can be. They do *not* generate background points directly, in order to allow
more flexible workflows based on clipping Boolean masks, for example.
