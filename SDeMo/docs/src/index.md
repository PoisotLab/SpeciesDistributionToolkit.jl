### Training and prediction

### Other model functions

```@docs

## Cross-validation

### Confusion matrix

```@docs

```

### Folds

These method will all take as input a vector of labels and a matrix of features,
and return a vector of tuples, that have the training indices in the first
position, and the validation data in the second. This is not true for `holdout`,
which returns a single tuple.
