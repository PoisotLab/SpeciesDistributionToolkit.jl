# # Zonal statistics

# In this tutorial, we will grab some bioclimatic variables for New Zealand, and
# then identify the districts that have extreme values of this variable.

# We will get the BIO19 layer from CHELSA2 (most precipitation in the coldest
# quarter):

spatial_extent =
    (left = 165.739746, bottom = -47.587547, right = 180.812988, top = -33.649514)
dataprovider = RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim)
layer = SDMLayer(dataprovider; layer = "BIO19", spatial_extent...)

# This layer is trimmed to the landmass (according to GADM):

mask!(layer, SpeciesDistributionToolkit.gadm("NZL"))
layer = trim(layer)

#-

# fig-trimmed-layer
fig, ax, plt = heatmap(layer; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
hidespines!(ax)
hidedecorations!(ax)

# We can now get the lower level sub-division:

districts = SpeciesDistributionToolkit.gadm("NZL", 2);

# We can start looking at how these map onto the landscape, using the `zone`
# function. It will return a layer where the value of each pixel is the index of
# the polygon containing this pixel:

# fig-districts
heatmap(zone(layer, districts); colormap = :hokusai, axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
current_figure() #hide

# Note that the pixels that are not within a polygon are turned off, which can
# sometimes happen if the overlap between polygons is not perfect. There is a
# variant of the `mosaic` method that uses polygon to assign the values:

z = mosaic(median, layer, districts)
nodata!(z, 0.0)

#-

# fig-zone-index
fig, ax, plt = heatmap(z; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
hidespines!(ax)
hidedecorations!(ax)
current_figure() #hide

# In order to make a plot identifying some areas, we get their full names using
# `gadmlist`:

districtnames = SpeciesDistributionToolkit.gadmlist("NZL", 2)
districtnames[1:10]

# Finally, we can get the median value within each of these polygons using the
# `byzone` method:

top5 =
    first.(
        sort(
            byzone(median, layer, districts, districtnames);
            by = (x) -> x.second,
            rev = true,
        )[1:5]
    )

    heatmap(layer; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()), colormap = [:lightgrey, :black])

    lines!(ax, districts[i]; label = districtnames[i], linewidth = 3) for
