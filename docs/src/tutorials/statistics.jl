# # Statistics on layers

# The purpose of this vignette is to demonstrate how we can use common statistical
# functions on layers.

# In this tutorial, we will have a look at the ways to transform layers and apply
# some functions from `Statistics`. As an illustration, we will produce a map of
# suitability for *Sitta whiteheadi* based on temperature and precipitation. As
# with other vignettes, we will define a bounding box encompassing out region of
# interest:

spatial_extent = (left = 8.412, bottom = 41.325, right = 9.662, top = 43.060)

# We will get our layers from CHELSA1. Because these layers are returned as `UInt16`, we
# multiply them by a float to get `Float64` layers.

dataprovider = RasterData(CHELSA1, BioClim)
temperature = 0.1SDMLayer(dataprovider; layer = "BIO1", spatial_extent...)
precipitation = 1.0SDMLayer(dataprovider; layer = "BIO12", spatial_extent...)

# A large number of functions from `Statistics` have overloads to be applied
# directly to the layers. We can get the mean temperature:

mean(temperature)

# Likewise, we can get the standard deviation:

std(temperature)

# Because of the way layers support arithmetic operations, we can esasily get the
# z-score of temperature as a layer:

z_temperature = (temperature - mean(temperature)) / std(temperature)

# This can be plotted. Note that we do not need to do anything on the layer
# itself, since the package comes pre-loaded with `Makie` recipes. This will be
# very useful when we start using `GeoMakie` axes to incorporate projections into
# our figures (which we will not do here...).

fig, ax, hm = heatmap(
    z_temperature;
    colormap = :broc,
    colorrange = (-2, 2),
    figure = (; resolution = (800, 400)),
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()),
)
Colorbar(fig[:, end + 1], hm)
current_figure()
save("temperature-zscore.png", current_figure()); nothing # hide

# ![z-score of temperature](temperature-zscore.png)

# Another option to modify the layers is to use the `rescale` method. When given
# two values, it will rescale the layer to be between these two values. This is
# useful if you want to bring a series of arbitrary values to some interval. As
# before, note that we can directly pass the GBIF object to `scatter` to show it
# on a map:

fig, ax, hm = heatmap(
    rescale(precipitation, (0.0, 1.0));
    colormap = :bamako,
    figure = (; resolution = (800, 400)),
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()),
)
Colorbar(fig[:, end + 1], hm)
current_figure()
save("precipitation-rescaled.png", current_figure()); nothing # hide

# ![Density of precipitation](precipitation-rescaled.png)

# To get a little more insights about the distribution of precipitation, we can
# look at the quantiles, given by the `quantize` function:

fig, ax, hm = heatmap(
    quantize(precipitation, 5);
    colormap = :bamako,
    figure = (; resolution = (800, 400)),
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()),
)
Colorbar(fig[:, end + 1], hm)
current_figure()
save("precipitation-quantiles.png", current_figure()); nothing # hide

# ![Density of precipitation](precipitation-quantiles.png)

# The `quantile` function also has an overload, and so we can get the 5th and 95th
# percentiles of the distribution in the layer:

quantile(temperature, [0.05, 0.95])
