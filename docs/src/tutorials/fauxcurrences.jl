# The methodology to generate fauxcurrences comes from [Osborne2022](@citet).

# ## Getting observed occurrence data

# Get the observation data in the correct format, which is an array of matrices
# with two rows (longitude, latitude) and one column for observed occurrence.
# This is usually an array of observations that are a subtype of
# `AbstractOccurenceCollection` (data returned from the GBIF package work), but
# all that matters is that this is a matrix with longitudes in the first row,
# and latitudes in the second row. The matrix *has* to be column-major, with
# observations as columns. To make sure that we cover a reasonable spatial
# extent, we will look at the rather small area in space (part of the Gaspésie
# region):

bbox = (bottom = 43.28, left = -66.5, top = 47.20, right = -59.45)
layer = SDMLayer(RasterData(CHELSA1, BioClim); layer = 1, bbox...)

# We will pick three species of *Iris* that are found in this area:

taxa = taxon.(["Iris hookeri", "Iris versicolor", "Iris pseudacorus"])
observations = [
    occurrences(t,
        layer,
        "occurrenceStatus" => "PRESENT",
        "limit" => 300) for t in taxa
]

# The last step is to turn these occurrences into a matrix of latitudes and
# longitudes:

obs = [Fauxcurrences.get_valid_coordinates(o, layer) for o in observations];

# The observed data are distributed this way:

# fig-observations
heatmap(layer; colormap = [:grey80, :grey80])
for i in eachindex(taxa)
    scatter!(obs[i]; label = taxa[i].name)
end
current_figure() #hide

# ## Preparing the run

# We need to decide on the number of points (pseudo-occurrences) to generate,
# and the weight matrix. The number of points to generate is, by default, the
# number of observations in the original dataset, but this can be changed to
# generate balanced samples. Here, we will pick 80 as a target number of
# occurrences:

points_to_generate = fill(50, length(obs))

# The weight matrix is used to determine whether intra or inter-specific
# distances are more important in the distribution score. For example, this will
# set up a scoring scheme where intra-specific distances count for 75% of the
# total. The only constraint is that the matrix `W` *must* sum to 1, which is
# enforced by the code internally:

W = Fauxcurrences.weighted_components(length(obs), 0.75)

# We then pre-allocate the objects. This is an important part of the run, as
# `Fauxcurrences` is built to *not* allocate more memory than needed. As such,
# these objects are going to be re-written many, many times. The upside is that,
# if this steps fits in your memory, the entire workflow will also fit in your
# memory.

obs_intra, obs_inter, sim_intra, sim_inter =
    Fauxcurrences.preallocate_distance_matrices(obs; samples = points_to_generate);

# The entire workflow is designed to use multiple species (as most relevant
# questions will require multiple species). Using a single-species approach only
# required to pass `[obs]` as opposed to `obs`.

# The next step is to measure the intra and inter-specific distances. This is an
# important step as *all generated points* will maintain the upper bounds of
# these distances matrices, *even if the inter-specific distance are
# weightless*.

Fauxcurrences.measure_intraspecific_distances!(obs_intra, obs);
Fauxcurrences.measure_interspecific_distances!(obs_inter, obs);

# ## Bootstrapping an initial proposal

# When the intra/inter specific distances are known, we can pre-allocate the
# objects to store the simulated coordinates, and then bootstrap a set of
# initial proposals. 

sim = Fauxcurrences.preallocate_simulated_points(obs; samples = points_to_generate);
Fauxcurrences.bootstrap!(sim, layer, obs, obs_intra, obs_inter, sim_intra, sim_inter);

# To prepare the scoring of the initial solution, we need to bin the distances
# between the actual and simulated data. Note that the package will *never*
# allow points in the simulated occurrences to create a distance matrix where
# the maximum distance is larger than the maximum distance in the empirical
# matrix.

bin_intra = [
    Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(obs_intra[i], maximum(obs_intra[i])) for
    i in axes(obs_intra, 1)
];
bin_inter = [
    Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(obs_inter[i], maximum(obs_inter[i])) for
    i in axes(obs_inter, 1)
];
bin_s_intra = [
    Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(sim_intra[i], maximum(obs_intra[i])) for
    i in axes(obs_intra, 1)
];
bin_s_inter = [
    Fauxcurrences._bin_distribution(sim_inter[i], maximum(obs_inter[i])) for
    i in axes(obs_inter, 1)
];

# This version of the `_bin_distribution` function is allocating an array for
# the bins, but the internal function is over-writing it, to avoid unwanted
# allocations. From the binned distances, we calucate the initial divergence.
# This will be the starting point between the observed and simulated
# distributions, and the score that we want to improve. Note that it accounts
# for the weights in the matrix. This step will return a vector, the sum of
# which is the total divergence between the matrices.

D = Fauxcurrences.score_distributions(W, bin_intra, bin_s_intra, bin_inter, bin_s_inter)
sum(D)

for i in eachindex(taxa)
    scatter!(sim[i]; label = taxa[i].name)

# ## Generating the fauxcurrences

# We can now setup the actual run. This step has infinitely many variations, as
# `Fauxcurrences` only offers a method to perform *a single step forward*. In
# most cases, using *e.g.* `ProgressMeter` will be a good way to track the
# progress of the run, and to allow, for example, to stop it when a collection
# of criteria (absolute/relative divergence, globally, on average, or
# per-species) are met. For the sake of simplicity, we return the sum of all
# divergences, measures for 500000 timesteps.

progress = zeros(Float64, 500_000)
progress[1] = sum(D)

# The `step!` function takes most of what we have allocated so far, which is a
# lot, but allows considerable performance gains. The last argument to `step!`
# is the current divergence, and the return value of `step!` (in addition to
# modifying the simulated points) is the new divergence.

# Before running the actual loop, it is a good idea to time a handful of steps.

# Why a handful? Because Julia do be compiling, and because depending on the
# structure of your points, the problem might be more or less difficult to
# solve. In practice, using `ProgressMeter` will make the timing of the whole
# process a lot more informative. In this simple version, we rely on a manually
# created progress report. Note that we stop the process when we have done at
# least 1×10⁵ steps, with no improvement over the last 2×10³.

for i in axes(progress, 1)[2:end]
    progress[i] = Fauxcurrences.step!(
        sim,
        layer,
        W,
        obs_intra,
        obs_inter,
        sim_intra,
        sim_inter,
        bin_intra,
        bin_inter,
        bin_s_intra,
        bin_s_inter,
        progress[i - 1],
    )
    if i > 100_000
        if abs(progress[i] - progress[i - 2000]) <= 1e-3
            break
        end
    end
    if iszero(i % 10_000)
        prct = lpad(round(Int64, 100*(i/length(progress))), 3)
        jsdiv = lpad(round(progress[i]; digits = 3), 5)
        impr = lpad(round(progress[begin] / progress[i]; digits = 3), 6)
        println(
            "[$(prct)%]\tJS-divergence: $(jsdiv)\tImprovement: $(impr)×",
        )

end

# The call to `step!` is... lengthy. The reason for this is very simple: `step!`
# will update as much information as it can *in place* when a change is made.
# This means that there are no objects created (only changed). The downside is
# that the function needs to be given a lot of information.

# Depending on the number of species (and the structure of the weight matrix),
# this step will be taking a little while. This is because, assuming we want *n*
# points for *r* species, each step has a complexity on the order of *rn²*,
# which isn't terribly good.

# ## Analyzing the fauxcurrences

# When the run is done, it would makes sense to look at the total improvement
# (or to plot the timeseries of the improvement):

final_progress =
    round(progress[begin] / progress[findlast(x -> x > 0, progress)]; digits = 3)
println(
    "Improvement: $(final_progress) ×",
)

#-

# fig-progress-lines
lines(
    progress[1:findlast(x -> x > 0, progress)];
    axis = (; yscale = sqrt, xlabel = "Iteration", ylabel = "JS divergence"),
    color = :black,
)
current_figure() #hide

# Note that for a small number of iterations (like we used here), this
# improvement is unlikely to be very large; note also that the returns (in terms
# of improvement over time) are very much diminishing. The good news is that
# re-starting the process is as easy as running the loop with calls to `step!`
# again, as the package has modified the matrices, and is ready to restart at
# any time. This is useful for checkpointing.

# The final disposition of the fauxcurrences is:

# fig-final-fauxcurrences
heatmap(layer; colormap = [:grey80, :grey80])
for i in eachindex(taxa)
    scatter!(sim[i]; label = taxa[i].name)
end
current_figure() #hide

# We can also look at the per-matrix score, out of all the distance bins (set as
# a package-wide variable, `Fauxcurrences._number_of_bins`, which you are
# encouraged to tweak) -- under a *good* fit, the lines in `bin_intra` and
# `bin_s_intra` would overlap (same with `..._inter`).

# For the intra-specific distances, with observations in black and the
# simulation in orange, this looks like:

# fig-distances-intra
