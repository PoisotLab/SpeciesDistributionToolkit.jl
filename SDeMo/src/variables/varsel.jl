    VariableSelectionStrategy

This is an abstract type to which all variable selection types belong. The
variable selection methods should define a method for `variables!`, whose first
argument is a model, and the second argument is a selection strategy. The third
and fourth positional arguments are, respectively, a list of variables to be
included, and the folds to use for cross-validation. They can be omitted and
would default to no default variables, and k-fold cross-validation.

Performs variable selection based on a selection strategy, with a possible
`folds` for cross-validation. If omitted, this defaults to k-folds.

The model is retrained on the optimal set of variables after training.

**Keywords**:

  - `included` (`Int[]`), a list of variables that must be included in the model
  - `optimality` (`mcc`), the measure to optimise at each round of variable
    selection
  - `verbose` (`false`), whether the performance should be returned after each
    round of variable selection
  - `bagfeatures` (`false`), whether `bagfeatures!` should be called on each model
    in an homogeneous ensemble
  - all other keywords are passed to `train!` and `crossvalidate`

**Important notes**:

 1. When using `bagfeatures` with a pool of included variables, they will always
    be present in the overall model, but not necessarilly in each model of the
    ensemble
 2. When using `VarianceInflationFactor`, the variable selection will stop even
    if the VIF is above the threshold, if it means producing a model with a lower
    performance -- using `variables!` will *always* lead to a better model
