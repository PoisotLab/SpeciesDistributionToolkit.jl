### SimpleSDMLayers

`SimpleSDMLayers` is a package to provide easy to use, georeferenced representations
of raster data to assist with the construction of species distribution models.
The package provides a *single* type, `SDMLayer`, which behaves like an array,
an iterable object, and a table. It furthers implements core operations on
rasters.
