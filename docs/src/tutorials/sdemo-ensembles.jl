# ## Getting the data
CHE = getpolygon(PolygonData(OpenStreetMap, Places), place="Switzerland")

# We get the data on the BioClim variables from CHELSA2:

provider = RasterData(CHELSA2, BioClim)
L = SDMLayer{Float32}[
    SDMLayer(
        provider;
        layer = x,
        SpeciesDistributionToolkit.boundingbox(CHE)...,
    ) for x in 1:19
];

# And we then clip and trim to the polygon describing Switzerland:

L = mask!(L, CHE)

# The next step is to get the data, using the *eBird* dataset:

ouzel = taxon("Turdus torquatus")
presences = occurrences(
    ouzel,
    first(L),
    "occurrenceStatus" => "PRESENT",
    "limit" => 300,
    "datasetKey" => "4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e",
)
while length(presences) < count(presences)
    occurrences!(presences)
end

# And after this, we prepare a layer with presence data.

presencelayer = mask(first(L), Occurrences(mask(presences, CHE)))

# The next step is to generate a pseudo-absence mask. There is a longer
# explanation on the ways to generate pseudo-absences in the "How-to" section of
# the manual. We will sample based on the distance to an observation, by also
# preventing pseudo-absences to be less than 4km from an observation:

background = pseudoabsencemask(DistanceToEvent, presencelayer)
bgpoints = backgroundpoints(nodata(background, d -> d < 4), 2sum(presencelayer))

# ## Setting up the model

# We will use a decision tree on data transformed through a PCA. Because we will
# eventually use an ensemble, we want the trees to be shallow (but not too
# shallow):

sdm = SDM(PCATransform, DecisionTree, L, presencelayer, bgpoints)
variables!(sdm, ForwardSelection, kfold(sdm))

# ## Making the first prediction

# We can predict using the model by giving a vector of layers as an input. This
# will return the output *as a layer* as well:

prd = predict(sdm, L; threshold = false)

# This gives the following initial prediction:

# fig-initial-map
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Prediction (tree)")
hm = heatmap!(ax, prd; colormap = :linear_worb_100_25_c53_n256, colorrange = (0, 1))
contour!(ax, predict(sdm, L); color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)
Colorbar(f[1, 2], hm)
lines!(ax, CHE; color = :black)
hidedecorations!(ax)
hidespines!(ax)
current_figure() #hide

# We can now create an ensemble model, by boostrapping random instances to train
# a larger number of trees:

ensemble = Bagging(sdm, 30)

# In order to further ensure that the models are learning from different parts
# of the dataset, we can also bootstrap which variables are accessible to each
# model:

bagfeatures!(ensemble)

# By default, the `bagfeatures!` function called on an ensemble will sample the variables
# forom the model, so that each model in the ensemble has the square root (rounded _up_) of
# the number of original variables.

# A probably better alternative is to reset the variables of our model:

variables!(ensemble, AllVariables)

# And then perform variable selection with feature bagging:

variables!(ensemble, ForwardSelection, kfold(sdm); bagfeatures = true)

# This will take longer to run, but will usually provide better results.

# ::: info About this ensemble model
# 
# The model we have constructed here is essentially a rotation forest. Note that
# the PCA is applied *to each tree*, so it is accounting for the selection of
# features, and does not introduce data leakage.
# 
# :::

# We can now train our ensemble model -- for an ensemble, this will go through
# each model, and retrain them with the correct input data/features.

train!(ensemble)

# Let's have a look at the out-of-bag error:

ensemble |> outofbag |> (M) -> 1 - accuracy(M)

# Because this ensemble is a collection of model, we set the method to summarize
# all the scores as the median:

prd = predict(ensemble, L; consensus = median, threshold = false)

# When the model is trained, we can make a prediction asking to report the
# inter-quartile range of the predictions of all models, as a measure of
# uncertainty:

unc = predict(ensemble, L; consensus = iqr, threshold = false)

## Heterogeneous ensembles

# We can also build ensembles of different models. Let's bring in the model we
# used in the previous tutorial:

sdm2 = SDM(ZScore, Logistic, L, presencelayer, bgpoints)
variables!(sdm2, [1, 11, 5, 8, 6])
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm2), :Î·, 1e-4);
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm2), :interactions, :all);
hyperparameters!(classifier(sdm2), :epochs, 10_000);

# As well as a Naive Bayes classifier:

sdm3 = SDM(RawData, NaiveBayes, L, presencelayer, bgpoints)
variables!(sdm3, ForwardSelection)

# These models can all be merged into an heterogeneous ensemble:

hens = Ensemble(sdm2, sdm3)
train!(hens)

# Heterogeneous ensembles can be used in the exact same way as bagged models, so
# we can for example predict the range according to the three models:

p_range = predict(hens, L; threshold = true, consensus = majority)

# fig-range-map
f = Figure(; size = (600, 300))
ax = Axis(f[1, 1]; aspect = DataAspect())
hm = heatmap!(ax, p_range; colormap = Reverse(:terrain), colorrange = (0, 1))
contour!(ax, p_range; color = :black, linewidth = 0.5)
