Candidate cells are weighted according to their distance to a known observation,
with far away places being more likely. Depending on the distribution of
distances, it may be a very good idea to flatten this layer using `log` or an
exponent. The `f` function is used to determine which distance is reported
(minimum by default, can also be mean or median).
