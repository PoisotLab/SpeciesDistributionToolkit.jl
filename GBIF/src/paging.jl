**Get the next page of results**

This function will retrieve the next page of results. By default, it will walk
through queries 20 at a time. This can be modified by changing the
`.query["limit"]` value, to any value *below* 200.

If filters have been applied to this query before, they will be *removed* to
ensure that the previous and the new occurrences have the same status.

"""
**Get all pages of results**

This function will retrieve *all* matches (up to the GBIF limit of 200000
records for a streaming query). It is recommended to set the limit to more than
the default of 20 before calling this function. If not, this will trigger a lot
of requests both from your end and on the GBIF infrastructure.

Internally, this function is simply calling `next!` until all records are
exhausted. This implies that the effect of filters that were previously applied
to the records will be removed.
