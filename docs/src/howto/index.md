# How-to

This section of the manual presents "How-tos", short capsules about getting you to achieve
a simple, well-defined task. Although there is some discussion of design elements for the
various packages, this is *not* the documentation; instead, you can think of this section as
a collection of snippets to copy and paste to build your own analysis.

::: tip To get the most out of the how-tos...

... it is a good idea to have an idea of what type of operation you want to perform. You may
find some inspiration in the "Tutorials" section of the manual. For more information about
all arguments, refer to the "Reference" section.
