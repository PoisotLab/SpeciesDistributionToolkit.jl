# Tutorials

This section of the manual offers in-depth explorations of the ways in which the different
packages that compose `SpeciesDistributionToolkit` interact. These present longer
illustrations with a well-defined question, that can correspond to steps in an actual
analysis.

::: tip To get the most out of the tutorials...

... it is encouraged to follow along. All the code that is required to run the analysis is
presented on the pages. Pay attention to the output of each step, and do not hesitate to
turn to the "Reference" section of the manual.

:::

It is a good idea to read the tutorials first; they are designed to give a sense of what
using the package is like, and most of them involve functions from all the component
packages. If you have a good use case that you wonder how to achieve with the package, feel
free to [share it](https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl/discussions/categories/ideas) on the Discussion page, so we can turn it into a tutorial!
